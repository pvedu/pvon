# pvon
Jupyter notebooks for using the photovoltaic library.
## Usage
The easiest way to view and run the notebooks is with Google Colab

### Google Colab
Google Colab is free with a Google account. Login to a Google account and then click one of the links below. It should load and run.


[solar_position](https://githubtocolab.com/pvedu/pvon/blob/master/solar_position.ipynb)
[semiconductor](https://githubtocolab.com/pvedu/pvon/blob/master/semiconductor.ipynb)
[antireflection](https://githubtocolab.com/pvedu/pvon/blob/master/antireflection.ipynb)

Alternatively, insert tocolab just after github in the link so:
 https://github.com/pvedu/pvon/blob/master/solar_position.ipynb becomes: https://githubtocolab.com/pvedu/pvon/blob/master/solar_position.ipynb
