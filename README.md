## Usage
### Download

### Google Colab
Google Colab is free. I forget if you have to sign up for it or it comes automatically with a Google Account. Anyway, once you have figured out how to sign into a colab account. You should be able to click on the links below and it will open in colab and you can run the code. 


[solar_position](https://githubtocolab.com/pvedu/pvon/blob/master/solar_position.ipynb)

Alternatively, insert tocolab just after github in the link so https://github.com/... becomes https://githubtocolab.com
