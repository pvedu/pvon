# pvon
Jupyter notebooks for using the photovoltaic library.
## Usage
The easiest way to view and run the notebooks is with Google Colab

### Google Colab
Colab is free with a Google account. Login to a Google account and then click one of the links below. It should load and run.

[basics](https://githubtocolab.com/pvedu/pvon/blob/master/basics.ipynb)

[solar_position](https://githubtocolab.com/pvedu/pvon/blob/master/solar_position.ipynb)

[solar_radiation](https://githubtocolab.com/pvedu/pvon/blob/master/solar_radiation.ipynb)

[solar_cell](https://githubtocolab.com/pvedu/pvon/blob/master/solar_cell.ipynb)

[solar_cell_IV_curves](https://githubtocolab.com/pvedu/pvon/blob/master/solar_cell_IV_curves.ipynb)

[semiconductor](https://githubtocolab.com/pvedu/pvon/blob/master/semiconductor.ipynb)

[antireflection](https://githubtocolab.com/pvedu/pvon/blob/master/antireflection.ipynb)

Alternatively, insert tocolab just after github in the link so:
 https://github.com/pvedu/pvon/blob/master/solar_position.ipynb becomes: https://githubtocolab.com/pvedu/pvon/blob/master/solar_position.ipynb

### Binder
Binder is slower to get started than colab but it loads everything and does not need an account. To use click on: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pvedu/pvon/master The files are first loaded for viewing. A run-time environment automatically loads after 30 seconds.

### Download
If you are not familiar with github, click on the **Code** button, and then click on **Download ZIP**.

## Installing Python
Downloading the files requires a python install. There's a gazillion ways to install python. I do the basics on Windows:

* install python https://www.python.org/downloads/
* pip install numpy
* pip install scipy
* pip install matplotlib
* pip install jupyter-lab
* pip install photovoltaic

Other options are with Anaconda etc.
